   I am a Software Engineer currently working as a Research Scientist (IT) at SAMEER, an autonomous R&D organization under MeitY, Government of India. I have over 2+ years of experience in developing and deploying software applications on Linux-based servers.

My core technical expertise in PHP, Laravel, Livewire, JavaScript, AJAX, Node.js, jQuery, and MySQL. I also work with Tailwind CSS, Bootstrap 5, and Apache2 to build user-friendly, responsive, and secure web applications.

I use GitLab (self-hosted) for version control and CI/CD pipelines, and Docker (self-hosted) for containerized development and deployment. I also have experience with C, C++, Python, HTML5, CSS3,  and linux.
